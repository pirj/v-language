{{{
Use ? to see the last parameter in the stack.
?? will show you the entire stack.
(The prompt is assumed to be '|')
ie.
|1 1
|??
=(1 1)
|+
|??
=(2)


differences from joy.

V allows internal definitions.
ie

[area
> [3.1415](pi.md).
> [dup \*](sq.md).
> sq pi **].**

The character literal is just ~x

V strives to be as much homoiconic as possible so a V program that is invoked
from the command line with args a b c is no different from this.
|a b c [v prog](my.md)i
ie: the args are pushed to the stack, the quote i passed to stack and dequoted.

Things that end with '&' are non destructive (they dont consume values from stack).
ie:
> |[2 3](1.md) first& ??
> =([2 3](1.md) 1)
> |[2 3](1.md) length& ??
> =([2 3](1.md) 3)

They have counterparts that do not have '&' in their name.
> [2 3](1.md) length => 3

some examples in V


qsort:

[qsort
> [small?]
> [.md](.md)
> [[>](uncons.md) split&]
> [[swap](swap.md) dip cons concat]
> binrec].

|[9 6 7 8 4 6 2](0.md) qsort ??
=([2 4 6 6 7 8 9](0.md))


getting the roots

[root
> [b c](a.md) let
> [dup \*](sqr.md).
> [b sqr 4 a \* c \* - sqrt](discr.md).
> [0 b - discr + 2 a \* /](root1.md).
> [0 b - discr - 2 a \* /](root2.md).
> "root1 :" put root1 puts
> "root2 :" put root2 puts
].

some points to mention here.
the let makes use of a slightly dirty word '@',
it defines things in the binding of its parent.
let is defined as [[unit cons rev @ true](rev.md) map pop]
It can be used in any place, not just inside a word definition.

it is probably not a good idea to use let, since the naming of internal
variables makes it impure both in both concatenative and functional terms.
The 'let' and '@' may disappear in the future (and '.' may become strict
about redefining words).

the root1 root2 and discr are internal definitions created
using '.'

Using throw and catch


eg:

[cmdthrows
> [
> > 'hi there throw' throw

> ] ['exception continued' puts ' more' throw](puts.md) catch
].
[mycmd
> [
> > cmdthrows

> ] ['exception caught' puts](puts.md) catch
].
mycmd

|mycmd
=hi there throw
=exception continued
=more
=exception caught

Using Java calls.

The word 'java' interprets the java method calls.  call syntax is
|[class/obj method](parameter.md) java
Primitive types are automatically converted to their java types.

|["I am here" length] java ?
=9

Here the string "I am here" is converted into a java.lang.String and then
the method length is invoked on this object.

Using a static method is the simplest operation on a class. The class name
is used as a symbol. If you pass a symbol in the place of class/obj it is
interpreted as a class name. else it is taken as a java object instance.

|[-100 java.lang.Math abs] java ?
=100

Invoking a constructor

|[java.util.Date new] java ?
={Tue Mar 13 19:59:22 IST 2007}

-- The java objects are always shown with '{}' around them.

and using that instance to invoke a method.
|unit [getDay](getDay.md) concat java ?
=2


Using an array as an argument.

|[[~a ~b ~c] java.lang.String new] java ?
='abc'

Accessing static fields

|[v.V version$] java ?
='0.002'

setting them.
|['0.001' v.V version$] java
|[v.V version$] java ?
='0.001'


Using the stack shuffling 'view'


[2](1.md) [[b](a.md) : a b] view
=1 2

'_' is used to ignore the value on the quote
'**' is used to indicate that there are 0 or more elements
left. and**xxx can be used to name them._

[2 3 4 5](1.md) [[\*rest](a.md) : **rest a] view
=2 3 4 5 1**

it can also be done on tail.

[2 3 4 5](1.md) [[**rest a] : a**rest] view
5 1 2 3 4

see the last examples for tests using view}}}
